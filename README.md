# django-react-app

This is the initial project, nothing special. Create a python environment to make organization easier. 
It uses django and react so get those if you can. You need npm to install react. You also need node.js at some point.

## Get Django

## Get React

### Open backend
To get started, pull the repository. Open two terminals. One should be open in the backend folder. The other should be open in the frontend folder.
From the terminal in the backend, run:
'''
python manage.py runserver
'''
This will link you to a localhost:8000. It will get a dead link, just add '/api/' at the end of the link.

### Open frontend
In the terminal open to the frontend, run:
'''
npm start
'''
This will automatically open up the link in your default browser. You can then add task to the task monitor.
